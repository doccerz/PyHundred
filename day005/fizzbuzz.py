Instructions
You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game. These are the rules of the FizzBuzz game:

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn and include number 100.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".`

And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"

e.g. it might start off like this:

1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
...etc

Hint
Remember your answer should start from 1 and go up to and including 100.

Each number/text should be printed on a separate line.
